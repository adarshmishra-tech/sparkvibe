# 🚀 SparkVibe – AI-Powered Business Bio & Social Content Generator

**Live Demo**: [https://sparkvibe-1.onrender.com](https://sparkvibe-1.onrender.com)

SparkVibe is my solo-built AI tool designed to help startups, creators, and professionals instantly generate sharp, compelling social media bios and business intros — tailored to their industry, tone, and vibe.

Whether you're launching a brand or just need the perfect LinkedIn intro, SparkVibe helps you write like a pro — without hiring one.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

Writing content that *sounds good* and *sells well* is hard — especially when you're not a copywriter.

I built SparkVibe because:
- I kept seeing founders struggle with basic bios or startup intros
- I wanted to use AI not just for fun, but to solve a real problem
- I had no funding or team — just code, a dream, and late nights

Now it's ~90% built and deployed on Render. It just needs a bit of support to go fully live.
